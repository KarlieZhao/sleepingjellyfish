"It’s been a while, since you last visited [the sea].";

"You can only (smell) little now, breathing {under the} [mask]. ";

"(Masks) have [changed] everything.";

"The [pandemic] has (changed) everything.";

"You’ve heard this word '(pandemic)' so many times it makes your head hurt behind your eyes. But you are here now, finally with {the [ocean]}.";

"(The ocean), ever since [you were a kid], a kid {weeping} at being left alone, and the ocean [responding].";

"The seaside was crowded when (you were a kid). It was such a popular tourist spot {for its purity} and the feathery, sugar-white sand. But there is [no one] here now.";

"(No one) anymore. {The world} enveloped in [panic] under [lockdown]."

"(Panic) {has} also taken hold of [you]. Panic, anxiety and, of course, {guilt}. ";

"Jumping [into the water], (you) feel you are far from {the earth}, the strange sense of [weightlessness].";

"It {has} been so long since [the last time] you threw yourself (into the water). You take extra {care}.";

"Was it (the last time), when you choked on the {unquiet} [salty water] diving?";

"(The salty water). The world settles {its graves} here. {But} [all you] want is dive, deeper.";

"(All you) need is {a peaceful sleep}. A peaceful sleep that {is never} going to be realised when alive. You keep [sinking].";

"(Sink) into the water. A [jellyfish]?";

"The beautiful, shiny (jellyfish) stretches out its body in front of you. It’s too late to realise it’s not [a creature]. You are surrounded by […]";

"The (memories) are [fading away]. The feeling of the fine sand {beneath} your feet, the sound of {the dark blue waves}, crashing on the shore, [and everything].";

"This is your visit to the sea.";

"[Everything will begin again.]";
